# tiny-compiler

A small compiler written in Python, for a very small subset of C.

While this compiler has no practical usage, its purpose have been to learn more about some concepts of compiler design with regards to the front-end phases. In particular I have been curious about implementing a front-end without using any lexer/parser generators, hence the very small subset of C that can be compiled.
